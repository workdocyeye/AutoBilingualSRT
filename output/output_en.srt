00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,500
Hello everyone

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,300
Welcome to my channel

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,100
Today I'd like to share some thoughts and insights on the use of AI

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,500
First of all

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,700
Get straight to the point

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,900
I believe all of us in the younger generation should go all in on AI.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,700
This is the opportunity that belongs to our generation.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:30,500
At this point, a significant number of people would consider AI to be nothing more than a chatting tool.

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,300
Not enough to stir up much of a storm

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,700
This is a completely wrong understanding of AI

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,100
as long as you take a little time to understand AI in depth

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,100
you'll find it's an absolutely groundbreaking technology

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,900
This holds true for any organization or individual alike.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,300
In my opinion

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,700
AI has permeated every aspect of my life.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,300
My studies and daily life are inseparable from this technology now.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,900
If I had to go without using AI for two days

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,300
My academic life will come to a standstill

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,100
If we have already realized the importance of AI

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,700
So how should we learn AI?

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,300
We are influenced by exam-oriented education.

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,700
It's easy to fall into such a misconception

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,100
Thinking that we must take learning AI seriously

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,500
Spend a lot of time in the library studying various aspects of AI

25
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,700
The history of AI development

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,300
All that useless AI knowledge crap

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,300
This is the flawed learning model that schools have imprinted upon us.

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,300
We must learn to shed this outdated

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,700
torturous learning mode

30
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,100
The way we learn should involve fully utilizing AI in our daily lives.

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,300
any questions

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Any thoughts

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,500
Explore every project with AI to see if it sparks new innovations

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:02,500
instead of learning through those outdated models that old professors have been using for over a decade

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,300
We should use AI to reshape our learning methods

36
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,500
This way you can experience the profound joy of progress.

37
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,500
Last but not least, this is something I particularly want to emphasize.

38
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,500
Learn to use AI to tackle all the bullshit work in college

39
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,300
Universities are filled with all sorts of meaningless nonsense.

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,100
a waste of energy

41
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
tormenting and stifling personal growth

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,900
various tasks that stifle human creativity

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,500
Find a way to use AI to tackle these tedious tasks

44
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,300
free up more time

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,300
Free up more energy to think about the issues you consider important

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,900
Learn what you consider important knowledge

47
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,300
a person's energy

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,700
Time is the most precious asset one has

49
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,900
It's not those damn tasks.

50
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
Fake credits

51
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,300
Also, if any school assignments prohibit the use of AI

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,900
Or limit the use of AI

53
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Then there's a 99% chance this task is already outdated.

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,300
AI can easily replace it.

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,700
The old evaluation system can no longer filter or screen effectively through this.

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,700
But the old evaluation system has inertia.

57
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,500
has a time lag

58
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,700
They won't let you pass these task evaluations so easily.

59
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
Take the thesis for example

60
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,900
If an undergraduate student can meet the standards of a graduation thesis with the help of AI

61
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,700
Then why waste more effort obsessing over those words?

62
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,500
Spending a ton of energy interacting with advisors to produce content universally acknowledged as meaningless for students' long-term development

63
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,700
Then why not let AI assist in solving these tasks?

64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,100
Calling it training students' abilities is all bullshit.

65
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,900
You should know that the ability to write papers

66
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,900
Long ago, it became utterly meaningless for students' personal development in society.

67
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,300
Now, with the added impact of AI, this is even more the case.

68
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,300
The more essential skill to master is the in-depth utilization of AI.

69
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,100
instead of being stuck in this distorted evaluation system

70
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,900
neither here nor there

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,500
We should think outside the box

72
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,100
Exploring the possibility of a breakthrough

73
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,300
instead of being constrained by all sorts of old rules that stifle judgment and creativity
