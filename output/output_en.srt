00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,366
Welcome to my channel

3
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:15,400
Today I'd like to share some thoughts and insights on the use of AI

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,100
First of all

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,800
get straight to the point

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,833
I believe all of us in the younger generation should go all in on AI.

7
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:33,866
This is the opportunity that belongs to our generation.

8
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:43,233
At this point, a significant number of people would think AI is just a chatting tool.

9
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:47,933
Not enough to stir up much of a storm

10
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:52,633
This is a completely wrong understanding of AI

11
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:58,666
As long as you take a little time to understand AI in depth

12
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:05,366
You'll find that this is truly a game-changing technology

13
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:12,066
This holds true for any organization or individual alike.

14
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,766
In my opinion

15
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:20,466
AI has permeated every aspect of my life

16
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:27,499
My studies and daily life have become inseparable from this technology.

17
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:32,533
If I had to go without AI for two days

18
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:36,899
My academic life would come to a standstill

19
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:42,933
If we have already realized the importance of AI

20
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:48,299
So how should we learn AI?

21
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:52,333
We are influenced by exam-oriented education

22
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:56,699
often fall into such a misconception

23
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:02,399
Believing that we must take learning AI seriously

24
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:11,099
Spending long hours in the library learning all kinds of knowledge about AI

25
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,799
The history of AI development

26
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:20,499
All that crap about AI and its so-called knowledge

27
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:27,533
This is the flawed learning model that schools have ingrained in us.

28
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:32,233
We must learn to shed this outdated mindset.

29
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:35,599
torturous learning mode

30
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:42,966
The way we learn should involve fully utilizing AI in our daily lives.

31
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,666
any questions

32
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,366
Any thoughts

33
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:56,066
Let's explore how AI can be integrated into any project to spark new possibilities.

34
00:02:56,266 --> 00:03:05,766
instead of using those outdated teaching methods from professors that have been obsolete for over a decade

35
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:12,466
We should use AI to reshape our learning methods

36
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:18,499
This way you can experience the profound joy of progress

37
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:24,199
Last but not least, this is something I particularly want to emphasize.

38
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:33,899
Learn to use AI to tackle the bullshit work in college

39
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:39,266
Universities are filled with all sorts of meaningless things.

40
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,966
a waste of energy

41
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,999
Tormenting and restricting personal growth

42
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,366
various tasks that stifle human creativity

43
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:57,399
Find a way to use AI to tackle these tedious tasks

44
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,099
Free up more time

45
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:06,799
Free up more energy to think about the issues you consider important

46
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:10,833
Learn what you believe is important

47
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,533
a person's energy

48
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:17,566
Time is the most precious asset one has

49
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:20,933
It's not those damn tasks.

50
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:23,633
Fake credits

51
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:31,999
Also, if any school assignments prohibit the use of AI

52
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,699
or restrict the use of AI

53
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:42,733
Then there's a 99% chance this task is already outdated.

54
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:46,766
AI can easily replace it

55
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:53,799
The old evaluation system can no longer filter or screen effectively through this.

56
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:58,499
But the old evaluation system has inertia.

57
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,199
with a time lag

58
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:09,233
They won't let you pass these task evaluations easily and casually.

59
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:13,266
Take writing a thesis for example

60
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:23,299
If an undergraduate student can meet the standards of a graduation thesis with the help of AI

61
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:30,333
Then why waste more effort obsessing over those words?

62
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:43,033
Spending a ton of energy interacting with advisors to produce content widely recognized as meaningless for students' long-term development

63
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:49,399
Why not use AI to assist in solving these tasks?

64
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:56,766
Calling it "developing students' abilities" is all bullshit.

65
00:05:56,966 --> 00:06:00,799
You should know that the ability to write papers

66
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:08,499
Long ago, it became meaningless for students themselves to develop in society.

67
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,533
Now, with the added impact of AI, this is even more the case.

68
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:19,899
The more essential skill to master is the deep utilization of AI.

69
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:25,599
rather than being stuck in this distorted evaluation system

70
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,299
neither here nor there

71
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:32,333
We should think outside the box

72
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:35,699
Exploring the possibility of a breakthrough

73
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:45,066
instead of being constrained by all sorts of outdated rules that limit one's judgment and creativity
